# external-parser-sample
A dumb, hand made, external parser for Plastic and Semantic only capable of creating "declarations trees" for 2 given files.

This sample code explains how to create a skeleton external parser to be used by Plastic SCM and SemanticMerge/SemanticDiff.

It is only able to parse the 2 files under the "sample" directory. It has a hardcoded "declaration tree" for each of the files.

It just serves to show how a very simple parser works as a basis to create real ones.
